These diagrams show the sensor output intensity when the ball is placed at any spot around it.

They were made by recording the intensity of each sensor when the ball was placed in seven 14 cm intervals infront of each sensor. The data was collected using the irCollection.ino file and the graph was made using gnuplot.





NOTE: THIS WAS THE OLD SENSOR WITH ONLY TSSP4038s CONNECTED TO A RC LOWPASS FILTER
