Hardware - Our Designs and Electronics
======================================

This section of the documentation will go over the specifics around our hardware, such as our electronic design process and 3D modelling.

We use Fusion 360 and Fusion 360 Electronics as our CAD software, and like before, associated files are available at our `GitHub <https://github.com/YuanYoshimi/RCJ-Soccer-Robot/>`_.

If you would like to download Fusion 360, the education edition is `free <https://www.autodesk.com/ca-en/products/fusion-360/education>`_. It contains all aspects of the paid license and is available to all students. Our files can be opened with the proper Fusion 360 Electronics and Fusion 360 software.
