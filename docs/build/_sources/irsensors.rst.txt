Infrared Sensors
================

The Infrared Sensors we used this year corresponded with the popular choices among past `competitions <https://github.com/robocup-junior/awesome-rcj-soccer?tab=readme-ov-file>`_.

We used the TSSP4038, which was a popular choice for IR detectors. We ordered ours from Mouser, but there are many other distributors who sell the TSSP4038.

Initially, we had first experimented with the data output. Our oscilloscope indicated that the output was essentially a square wave. We did not understand the intensities at this point in time, so we placed a low-pass filter on it in order to read the square wave value as an analog input.
